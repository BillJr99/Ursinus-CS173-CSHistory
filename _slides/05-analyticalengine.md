## The Analytical Engine

- Charles Babbage (1837) proposed the **Analytical Engine** - a design for a modern computer using punch cards \[[^1]\]

- Ada Lovelace proposed the first **Algorithm** to compute the sequence of Bernoulli Numbers to be executed on the Analytical Engine
  - The engine was not completed during her lifetime, so it could not be executed, but this was the first computer program \[[^2]\]
