- Godfried Leibniz (1689) proposed a binary number system, derived from the *I Ching* (based on yin and yang) \[[^1]\]
- George Boole (1847): **The Mathematical Analysis of Logic** - used a binary system to propose Boolean Algebra (AND, OR, NOT)
  - *Tent*: *Warm* **AND** **NOT** *Raining* 
- Claude Shannon (1937) applied binary to circuits
  - This led to the publication of his **The Mathematical Theory of Communication** (1948), giving rise to modern Information Theory and digital communications
  - Coined the term "bit"
- Joseph Jacquard's Loom (1801): textile weaving from binary codes encoded on punch cards \[[^2]\]
