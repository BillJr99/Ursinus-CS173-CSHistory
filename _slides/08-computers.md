## Modern Computer Architectures

- John Von Neumann (1946): **Von Neumann Architecture**
  - Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC)
    - Shorter, more consistent clock cycles
    - Complex instructions are composed of RISC instructions
      - Complex instruction sets (CISC) encode more meaning into each larger instruction
  - Arithmetic, Conditionals, Branches
  - Loops could be made by combining conditionals and branches
  - Computer Registers
  - Single bus for instruction and data memory (unified memory)
- Harvard Architecture
  - Similar to the above, but instruction and data memory are separated for simultaneous access
