## Turing Machines

- **Church-Turing Thesis** (1936): mathematical representation of a "function" that must be expressed in small, basic steps that could be carried out mechanically \[[^1]\]
  - It doesn't matter if the steps are so tedious that the process would take a long time, because we can eventually use this model to automate the process with fast computers
  - Turing Machine: a theoretical mechanism that can carry out computations using binary and simple read/write/shift instructions on a tape
- The Algorithm (Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizimi, c. 800 CE) \[[^2]\]
  - Derived from his book on Algebra as a definition of a process
  - Used to define the process of steps undertaken by a Turing Machine
