## Turing Machines

- **Church-Turing Thesis** (1936): mathematical representation of a "function" that must be expressed in small, basic steps that could be carried out mechanically \[[^1]\]
  - It doesn't matter if the steps are so tedious that the process would take a long time, because we can eventually use this model to automate the process with fast computers
